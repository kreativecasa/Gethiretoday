  {
    q: "Is the free plan actually free?",
    a: "Yes — forever. No credit card required. You can create and download your resume on the free plan without ever entering payment details. Upgrade only when you want more.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the $2/month Pro plan?",
    a: "Everything: unlimited resumes, all 60+ templates, PDF and Word downloads, full AI content generation, AI bullet point writer, real-time ATS scoring, cover letter builder, priority support, and new templates added every month.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    a: "Absolutely. Cancel in one click from your account settings. No penalties, no questions, no runaround. You keep access to Pro features through the end of your billing period.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    a: "We accept all major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) via Stripe. Apple Pay and Google Pay are also supported on compatible devices.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a money-back guarantee?",
    a: "Yes — 14 days, no questions asked. If you're not completely satisfied within 14 days of upgrading to Pro, contact our support team and we'll issue a full refund immediately.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is GetHireToday different from competitors?",
    a: "Our competitors charge $29–$40/month for similar features. We charge $2/month — that's 15x cheaper. We believe everyone deserves access to great career tools, not just people who can afford expensive subscriptions. Plus, our ATS scoring engine is built on analysis of real recruiter feedback.",
